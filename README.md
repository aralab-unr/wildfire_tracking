# wildfire_tracking

To run the DQN with state estimators, we have 2 scripts with 2 different configurations/settings. 
They are entirely independent of each other and are different simulations with different approaches. 
```
1. python3 state_est_dqn_obsv_test.py
```

```
2. python3 state_est_dqn_test.py
